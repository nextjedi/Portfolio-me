### ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Hierarchical JSON Structure with Zero Repetition

  - Built reference resolution system in PortfolioService
  - Updated all service methods to work with hierarchical structure
  - Maintained backward compatibility for all components
- **Benefits Achieved**:

  - **Hierarchical Organization**: Projects organized by category with clear structure
  - **Reference Resolution**: Automatic `@shared.xxx` reference resolution at load time

- **Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and functional

### ✅ FIXED: Navigation Issues on Project Detail Pages
- **Problem**: Navigation links didn't work when on project detail pages

- **Solution**: Implemented smart routing-aware navigation system
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated NavigationComponent to use Router for navigation
  - Added intelligent section navigation that works from any page
  - Logo and nav links now properly navigate to home page first, then scroll to sections

- **Status**: ✅ Fully fixed and functional

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Project Categorization System

  - Shows category tabs only when multiple categories exist
  - Hides categories entirely if only one category present
  - Displays project counts in tab labels
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated Project interface with category field
  - Added category filtering logic to ProjectsComponent
  - Integrated Material Design tabs for category selection
  - Enhanced portfolio data with 6 projects across all categories
- **Features**:
  - Professional: Enterprise/work projects (2 projects)
  - Side Projects: Open-source/personal projects (2 projects)

  - Added URL slug generation utility to `PortfolioService`
  - Implemented dynamic routing with route parameters

  - SEO-friendly URLs with project slugs

### ✅ FIXED: Project Image Click Not Working
- **Problem**: Clicking on project image overlay didn't trigger case study dialog
- **Root Cause**: Image overlay had "View Case Study" text but no click handler
- **Solution**: Added click handler to project image container
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `(click)="showCaseStudy()"` to `.project-image` element
  - Added `cursor: pointer` CSS to indicate clickability
  - Now both image click and button click show the same case study dialog
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and functional

### ✅ FIXED: Hero Section Button Styling Issues
- **Problem**: "Let's Talk" and "Download Resume" buttons without proper styling
